# MoodRecommendationSystem
Honours Research project 2021

Some music recommendation systems do not consider the uniqueness of song items well enough to be able to classify these by the general mood and feel they may give off. The purpose of this report is to thus create a system that attempts to solve this problem and create a  model to categorise each musical item by mood using their content-based features. The model of choice is the Gaussian Maximization Model since it allows the creation of inferences modelled in a computationally efficient way. The dataset  to  be  explored  is  the publicly available Spotify  dataset  which  comes  with  pre-processed  content-based features  of  different  songs  from  the  era  1920-2020.  Once this is done, I will then compare the different silhouette scores and Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) score obtained by this model with the score obtained by KMeans clustering algorithm which serves as the benchmark model we hope to improve on.
